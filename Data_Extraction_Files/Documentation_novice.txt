The documentation generated for novice is as follows:
- **BubbleSort_csharp.txt**: This file contains an implementation of Bubble Sort in C#, where it sorts an array in ascending order by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. It also includes a binary search function to find an element in the sorted array.
- **MergeSort_js.txt**: This JavaScript file contains both Merge Sort and Binary Search functions. Merge Sort is used here for sorting an array in ascending order by dividing it into smaller subarrays, sorting them individually, and then merging them back together. The binary search function finds a specific item within a sorted list using divide-and-conquer technique to cut down the amount of data to be searched through.
- **MergeSort_py.txt**: This Python file contains two functions - Merge Sort and Binary Search. In merge sort, it divides the array into equal halves, sorts them separately then merges them back together in a sorted manner. The binary search function finds an element by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the value is found or the interval is empty.
- **QuickSort_js.txt**: This JavaScript file contains Quick Sort implementation and Binary Search. In Quick sort, elements are divided into two parts which are then sorted independently using a divide-and-conquer strategy called recursion. The binary search function finds an element by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the value is found or the interval is empty.

Each file includes comments explaining what each section of code does, including dependencies and any important information about running or testing the code. This makes it easy for a beginner to understand how each sorting algorithm works and why certain decisions were made during its implementation.
