# MergeSort_js.txt Documentation
Merge sort, also known as merge-sort algorithm, sorts an array by dividing it into two equal halves (or nearly equal), then merging them back together in order. The JavaScript code provided does this with functions `merge()` and `merge_sort()`. 

The function `merge()` takes four arguments: the input array (arr), the beginning of the first half (begin), the end of the first half (mid) and the end of the array (end). It merges two halves into one, maintaining order by comparing elements from both halves. 

The function `merge_sort()` is a recursive function that divides an input array into single-element arrays because those are already sorted (this process is known as 'splitting'), then it repeatedly merges these smaller arrays back together in the correct order, resulting in a new, completely ordered array. 

# MergeSort_java.txt Documentation
Java code provided uses merge sort algorithm to sort an integer array. It defines two functions: `merge()` and `mergeSort()`. The function 'merge' merges two sub-arrays of arr[]. The size of left and right halves are given as l1, l2 respectively where l1 is the number of elements in first half of the array. 

The main function 'mergeSort', takes mid point to divide array into two halves, then calls merge() for sorting and merging those two parts. Merge sort follows a Divide and Conquer approach as it repeatedly divides original problem into sub-problems until these become simple enough to solve directly.

# MergeSort_csharp.txt Documentation
The C# code provided sorts an integer array using the merge sort algorithm. Two methods are defined: `Merge()`, which merges two halves of a split array in order and `MergeSort()`, which recursively splits arrays until they become single elements to be merged back together. 

`MergeSort()` also finds the mid-point index for splitting an array into two halves. These sorted halves are then combined using `Merge()` to create a completely ordered array. The algorithm continues this process of recursively sorting and merging until there is only one unsorted element left in the array.

# MergeSort_php.txt Documentation
PHP code provided uses merge sort algorithm to sort an integer array, with functions `merge()` which sorts two sub-arrays before calling itself, and `mergeSort()` function which divides input array into halves until they can no longer be split and then merges them back together in order. 

Both these functions utilize a recursive method to divide the unsorted array until individual elements are left. These arrays are then sorted again by matching up each element with its partner from another half of an array, combining them into one completely ordered set.

# MergeSort_ruby.txt Documentation
Ruby code provided uses merge sort algorithm on an integer array to sort the numbers in ascending order. Two methods are defined: `merge()` that merges two arrays back together after they have been sorted, and `merge_sort()` which recursively splits an unsorted array until each individual element is a part of its own array, then sorts them with merge().

# MergeSort_go.txt Documentation
The Go code provided uses merge sort algorithm to sort integer slices. Two functions are defined: 'Merge' that merges two sorted halves back into one, and 'MergeSort', a recursive function that divides an array into smaller arrays until they become individual elements to be merged back together in order.

# MergeSort_swift.txt Documentation
Swift code provided uses the merge sort algorithm to sort integer values within a collection type variable (array). The functions `merge()` and `mergeSort()` are defined, where 'merge' function is used to merge two sorted arrays into one and 'mergeSort' divides an array in half until it can no longer be divided.

# MergeSort_rs.txt Documentation
The Rust code provided sorts integer values using the merge sort algorithm. It contains two functions: `merge()`, which merges two halves of a split list into one ordered list, and `mergesort()`, a recursive function that divides an unsorted array until it can no longer be divided and then uses 'merge' to arrange them back in order.

# MergeSort_cpp.txt Documentation
C++ code provided utilizes the merge sort algorithm for integer arrays to sort numbers in ascending order. The functions `merge()`, which merges two sorted halves into one, and `mergeSort()` are used to divide an array until each individual element is a part of its own half, then they're merged back together in order using `merge()`.

# MergeSort_pl.txt Documentation
Perl code provided sorts integer values using merge sort algorithm. The functions 'merge', which merges two halves of an array into one sorted array and 'merge_sort', a recursive function that splits the array until it is just individual elements, then uses `merge` to arrange them back in order.

# MergeSort_scala.txt Documentation
Scala code provided sorts integer values using merge sort algorithm. It includes two methods: `merge()` which merges two sorted arrays into one and `mergeSort()`, a recursive function that divides an array until each individual element is its own subset of the array to be merged back together in order.

# MergeSort_cs.txt Documentation
C# code provided uses merge sort algorithm for integer arrays to sort numbers in ascending order. Two methods are defined: `Merge()`, which merges two sorted halves back into one and `MergeSort()` that divides an array until it can no longer be divided. These steps are repeated using the `Merge()` method to arrange them back in order.

# MergeSort_kt.txt Documentation
Kotlin code provided sorts integer values using merge sort algorithm. It contains two functions: `merge()` which merges two sorted halves into one, and `mergeSort()` that recursively divides an array until each individual element is a part of its own half, then uses 'merge' to arrange them back in order.

# MergeSort_elm.txt Documentation
Elm code provided sorts integer values using merge sort algorithm. It includes two functions: `merge` which merges two sorted arrays into one and `mergeSort` that recursively divides an array until it can no longer be divided, then uses 'merge' to arrange them back in order.

# MergeSort_ml.txt Documentation
OCaml code provided sorts integer values using merge sort algorithm. It includes two functions: `merge` which merges two sorted arrays into one, and `mergeSort` that recursively divides an array until it can no longer be divided, then uses 'merge' to arrange them back in order.

# MergeSort_rkt.txt Documentation
Racket code provided sorts integer values using merge sort algorithm. It includes two functions: `merge` which merges two sorted lists into one and `mergesort` that recursively divides an unsorted list until it can no longer be divided, then uses 'merge' to arrange them back in order. 

# MergeSort_sql.txt Documentation
The SQL code provided is used for sorting data retrieved from a database using the merge sort algorithm. It does not contain any executable code as this would require actual database access and manipulation which cannot be demonstrated here. Please consult with an appropriate source to implement it in your environment.

# MergeSort_vb.txt Documentation
VB.NET code provided sorts integer values using the merge sort algorithm. Two methods are defined: `Merge()`, which merges two sorted arrays back into one and `MergeSort()` that divides an array until it can no longer be divided.
