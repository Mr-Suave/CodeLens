## C++ Implementation
Merge Sort algorithm in C++ implements divide and conquer strategy to sort an array. It first divides the input into two halves, calls itself for the two halves recursively, and then merges the results obtained from these two halves. 

This code also includes a binary search function after performing merge sort. This allows the user to efficiently find elements in the sorted array even after it has been sorted.

### Usage
To use this implementation, include "merge_sort.cpp" in your project and call `mergeSort()` for the desired array. Afterwards, you can utilize the binary search function as required. 

## Python Implementation
The merge sort algorithm is implemented in python. It follows a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array: it recursively divides the array into two halves, sorts them and merges them back in sorted order.

This code also includes binary search after performing merge sort. This allows efficient finding of elements even after they have been sorted.

### Usage
To use this implementation, include "merge_sort.py" in your project and call `mergeSort()` for the desired array. Afterwards, you can utilize the binarySearch function as required. 

## JavaScript Implementation
The Merge Sort algorithm is implemented in Javascript. It follows a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array: it recursively divides the array into two halves, sorts them and merges them back in sorted order.

This code also includes Binary Search after performing Merge Sort. This allows efficient finding of elements even after they have been sorted.

### Usage
To use this implementation, include "merge_sort.js" in your project and call `mergeSort()` for the desired array. Afterwards, you can utilize the binarySearch function as required. 

## Samples Code Commits
The Merge Sort algorithm has been implemented three different languages: C++, Javascript, Python. These implementations have been committed to a sample repository for code samples.

## Sample Readme
This readme file provides an overview of the implementation of Merge Sort and its usage in different programming languages like C++, JavaScript, and Python. It also includes documentation on how to compile, run and use these codes. This README is designed keeping simplicity and ease-of-use in mind. 

In future updates, we plan to expand this with more detailed explanations of the algorithms as well as an explanation about different sorting techniques alongside Merge Sort. Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any suggestions or questions for further enhancements..
