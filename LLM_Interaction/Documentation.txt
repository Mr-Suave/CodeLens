Sure, here is a brief overview of each file:

## merge_sort.cpp
This C++ implementation includes two separate functions for Merge Sort and Binary Search. The Merge Sort function (`mergeSort()`) takes an array and its length as parameters and sorts the array using the divide-and-conquer approach. The Binary Search function (`binarySearch()`) takes a sorted array, its length, and a target value to search for in the array.

## merge_sort.py
This Python implementation also includes two separate functions: `mergeSort()` and `binarySearch()`. They work similarly to their C++ counterparts. The Merge Sort function (`mergeSort()`) takes an array as its argument and returns a sorted version of that array. The Binary Search function (`binarySearch()`) also takes a sorted array and a target value, returning the index of the target value in the array if it exists.

## merge_sort.js
This JavaScript implementation is similar to its C++ and Python counterparts. It includes two functions: `mergeSort()` and `binarySearch()`. Both functions are designed to work with arrays. The Merge Sort function (`mergeSort()`) accepts an array as input, divides it into halves until they are individual elements, then merges them back together in sorted order. The Binary Search function (`binarySearch()`) takes a sorted array and a target value, returning the index of the target value if it exists in the array.

## Usage
To use these functions, simply call them with the appropriate arguments. Here's an example:
```javascript
let arr = [12, 34, 11, 9, 3];
arr = mergeSort(arr);
console.log(binarySearch(arr, 11)); // Output: 2 (index of 11 in the sorted array)
```
This JavaScript code first sorts `arr` using Merge Sort and then searches for the value 11 using Binary Search. The output will be the index of 11 in the sorted array.
